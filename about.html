                        <p>In the early 1980s, brothers Luther and Michael were intrigued by the emergence of affordable personal computing. 
                        They read all they could on the subject and even built their own computer from parts they had acquired. To share their knowledge and
                        enthusiasm for this new field, they founded a computer literacy school to teach small business owners how to use this powerful technology.
                        One of their students, an independent insurance agent, asked the prophetic question: "Can personal computers be used to rate and compare 
                        multiple insurance companies to find the best rate?" The answer was of course, "Yes". They authored the first version of CCiRater shortly 
                        thereafter and introduced comparative rating to the insurance industry.</p>
